Write a webcrawler program that finds links in the HTML source code
for that page. After writing the source code to a text file in
html_source folder, a feature extractor is run against all the HTML
sources and a feature vector and its info is saved in unigrams.

1) Before execution, a folder named "html_source" and "unigrams" must
be saved in the folder with the program. 
2) Compile "webcrawler.cpp" using your preferred method.
3) Run webcrawler in the command line.
4) You will be prompted first for a root URL, then for the depth you want
to search.

The program will terminate upon completion of the search.
